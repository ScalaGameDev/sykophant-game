Console should be animated and should resize to display automagically (code like html and jquery)

Need to make the model from magicavoxel import into chunks for the TerrainWorld class - then be built and attached to rootnode



## Timeline
Make the console animate when it opens and closes
Make the console show an animated progress bar as the game is loading (gamestate node does not attach until rdy)

Get the voxels to render perfectly (not overlapping, not 90 degrees)

//see https://hub.jmonkeyengine.org/t/yave-yet-another-voxel-engine-dev-blog/30203

Add physics
Add player movement (very similar to quake- sprint and leap around)

Add acid and lava voxels that glow
Add torch(fire) voxels that glow 

Get the voxels to render small and ultra efficiently 




Add a simple editor state to add decorations to maps ?(this is hard to do in magicavoxel) 
OR- decoration is done because the voxels are way smaller..

## Main Menu

Splash Screen shows "Ultra Black Blood Death" banner which is a screenshot of a dynamically lit part of a map.. has a brushed mask around it that is gritty
There is a ultra crazy insane metal guitar riff that plays simultaneously

Then, that disappears and a ton of boot code appears that is really the boot code for the game (the logs) like a raspi.  It all types out in an animated way.
A Message appears at the bottom that states "Please enter your command:"
If a bogus command is entered, remind them in a funny random way that they can type "help" 



## Bugs
Why do the blocks seem to be rotated sideways ? (y vs z?)
On linux, the camera is broken


## Backburner
This game will be for sale but will also be open source
