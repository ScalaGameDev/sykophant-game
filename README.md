-convert terminal menu to scala
-make the Host option publish a CoreEvent which sets of a chain of events - starts a dedicated server
-made the Join option with an ip addres given publish another CordEvent which will make a remoteclient who joins that server
-When a new client Joins, spawn a unit and make the camera focus on him.  The person who is the host will have a host and client running.


## Backburner
* Needs lots of particles
* cool respawn animation (particles) and sound
* Should feel a lot like doom and quake1
* I love the code seen when joining a server
